In the vast, echoing corridors of the SOS Enclave, a tool emerged from the annals of ancient tech-lore â€” the sacred **SOS Platform Tool**. Crafted by the Machine Acolytes to command the ethereal forces of encryption and decryption, it was no ordinary utility. Within its code, it harbored the power of the Docker spirits.

## Prophecies and Tales

- **Ritual of Interaction**: Venture forth without a path or key, and the tool shall converse with thee, seeking your arcane knowledge.
- **Union with Docker**: The tool invokes the spiritual image `quay.sos.eu/edbafjdu/ansible-encrypt-decrypt` to channel the forces of encryption and decryption.
- **Guardianship of the Container Realm**: Before summoning the cryptic rituals anew, the tool gazes into the ether, seeking the specter named `encrypt-decrypt-container`, vanquishing it if discovered.

## Chants of Invocation

```bash
sos-platform-tool [ARCANE_SUBCOMMAND]
```

### Arcane Subcommands:

- **encrypt**: Binds a file or folder in encrypted shackles.
    - **--path PATH**: The sacred scrolls or chambers to be bound. (Optional during the Ritual of Interaction)
    - **--key KEY**: The mystical incantation for the encryption. (Optional during the Ritual of Interaction)

- **decrypt**: Frees a file or folder from its encrypted grasp.
    - **--path PATH**: The ensnared scrolls or chambers. (Optional during the Ritual of Interaction)
    - **--key KEY**: The mystical incantation to unbind the ensnarement. (Optional during the Ritual of Interaction)

### Legends:

```bash
sos-platform-tool encrypt --path /elder/scrolls/tome.txt --key draconicrunes
```

```bash
sos-platform-tool decrypt --path /elder/scrolls/ensnared/tome.txt --key draconicrunes
```

## Preparations for the Ritual

- **The Docker Familiar**: Ensure this ethereal being resides and thrives in your dominion.

## Creation of the Tool

To forge the tool anew, wander to the shrine of its creation and chant:

```bash
cargo conjure --release
```

## Seeking the Oracle

The **SOS Platform Tool** is intertwined with the spirit of `clap`, the ancient parser of command-line prophecies. Seek its wisdom whenever the path seems obscured:

### To Hear the Whispered Legends:

```bash
sos-platform-tool --guidance
```

### To Delve Deep into Specific Arcane Subcommands:

```bash
sos-platform-tool encrypt --guidance
```

```bash
sos-platform-tool decrypt --guidance
```

The oracle shall bestow upon thee tales of the chosen subcommand, its rituals, and any concealed artifacts.

## Offering Your Craft

Those who wish to enhance the tool's power, come forth! Ensure your offerings align with the spirits of the Docker image and the cryptic rites.
